# Guard Panel by PhuMene
This is a small project which consists of having a full functionnal british train doors' panel for Guards.
More stuff may come in the future.

## How does it work?
First off, you have to switch the DOOR KEY SWITCH on which will activate the panel and then let you control it.
If you wanna know how this would normally work, read below:
### Normal Guarding Process:
##Notice: This is only based on the usual guarding process in Stepford County Railway.
- Key switch ON (Diamond)
- Local door switch OPEN
- Open doors (Red buttons, both work)
- Wait some time (you can skip that step)
- ~Whistle~ (Not implemented)
- Close doors (Dark blue button)
- ~Whistle~ (Not implemented)
- Local door switch CLOSE
- Signal (Doesn't sound yet.)
